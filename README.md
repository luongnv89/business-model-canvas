## Business Model Canvas

All code is included in `index.html` and as an experiment GSS is used instead of (directly) CSS. To find more information about GSS, go to http://gridstylesheets.org/.

Even though the project is static, for convenience, a node server is included (you can even deploy this on Heroku directly):

```
$ bower install
$ npm install
$ node web.js
```
